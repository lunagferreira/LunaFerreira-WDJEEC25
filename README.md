## Challenge details

You will have to create a Vue3 carousel with four slides.
You should store your code in Github. If you have never used Github before you must create an account and follow the information provided in the links below.
Finally, you will be required to attend an interview, during which, you will have the chance to present your work.
Additionally, there will be a mini challenge that you will have to do on the spot, so come prepared.

### Slides in carousel
- Slides:

  1. In this slide, write/show a question of your choice. Outside the carousel, we want you to display the answer to the question.
  2. This slide must have an input of a date (in dd/mm/yyyy or in stupid format). You will once again display the date that was inserted outside the carousel.
  3. This slide follows the structure of **challenge2.png**, you can add any text (be creative), not necessary to be the one in the image. In order to do this, you should use flexbox.
  4. Lastly, display an image: **challenge.png**.
